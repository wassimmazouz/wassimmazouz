# Hello there!

[![LinkedIn Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-wassimmazouz-blue?style=flat-square&logo=LinkedIn&logoColor=white&link=https://www.linkedin.com/in/wassimmazouz/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wassimmazouz/)

I'm **Wassim MAZOUZ**, a final-year engineering student at [Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/en), specializing in **Mathematics and Risk Engineering** ([MIR](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/formation/ingenieure-generaliste/programme-formation/parcours-electif/offre-formation-parcours?module=2631437)). In parallel, I am completing the **Quantitative Finance** program ([GRAF](https://isfa.univ-lyon1.fr/formation/econometrie-statistiques/programme-du-parcours-graf)) at [ISFA](https://isfa.univ-lyon1.fr/).

Currently, I am an **AI & Quantitative Research Intern** at **BNP Paribas Global Markets - Data & AI Lab** in Frankfurt, working on **Deep Reinforcement Learning for Hedging**, adapting theoretical models to real market conditions.

Previously, I was a **Machine Learning Research Intern** at the [OCKHAM](https://team.inria.fr/ockham/team-members/) Team at ENS Lyon, enhancing the [Benchopt](https://benchopt.github.io/) framework for benchmarking optimization algorithms. I also conducted research at **LIRIS Laboratory**, developing image generation algorithms using **Wave Function Collapse** and **Quantized Autoencoders**.

I'm passionate about machine learning, quantitative finance, and problem-solving. Whether it's optimizing models, designing new tools, or exploring complex mathematical concepts, I enjoy tackling real-world challenges.

Feel free to check out my repositories, connect with me, or collaborate on exciting projects!
